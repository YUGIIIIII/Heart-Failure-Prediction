# Heart-Failure-Prediction

This project explores machine learning models for predicting heart failure outcomes. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and building classification models to evaluate clinical data.

Sections
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizes relationships and trends in the dataset.
Identifies key features influencing heart failure predictions.
2. Data Preprocessing
Applies techniques like scaling and feature selection.
Splits the dataset into training and testing sets for robust model evaluation.
3. Classification Models
Implements models such as:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Optimizes hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
4. Evaluation
Measures model performance using:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
Confusion Matrix
ROC-AUC Score
